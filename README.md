This is a fun project I wanted to build from scratch.

Training is expensive but inference is even more expensive. I want to understand how inference in
these foundation models works and how we can optimize it. Speed and compute are everything.


AI Usage:

I wrote all of the code myself except for some of the tests in the tests/ folder. I thought the models
could write more comprehensive tests than myself and it left me more time to work on the actual inference engine.
